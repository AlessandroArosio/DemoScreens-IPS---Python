# DemoScreens-IPS---Python
Python script for DemoRoom

Just few lines of code to execute in background four playlists with demostration videos.
The software on the system caused many bugs when left in background, running for more than 24 hours.
This script creates a thread that kills every 12 hours the process and starts again the playlists on all the 4 screens for demonstration purposes.
